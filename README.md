MITx6.00x
=========

Various coding problems done for MITx 6.00x - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming. This should motivate me to comment my code.

The main folder contains various practice problems/finger exercises from throughout the course, while ProblemSets contains homework for each week.

The ProblemSets directory contains homework for each week, organized by week. These files contain both helper code provided by MIT and original code written by me. In most cases, it should be pretty clear which is which, although I will try to reflect this accurately in my commits starting with Week 6.
